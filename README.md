# ML Foundations

Clean, minimal implementations of core machine learning concepts.
Focus: conceptual clarity and interview-explainable code.

## 📂 Structure
- `supervised_learning/` - Regression, classification, regularization
- `unsupervised_learning/` - Clustering, dimensionality reduction
- `data_preparation/` - EDA, feature scaling, preprocessing
- `metrics_and_validation/` - Cross-validation, evaluation metrics

## 🎯 Philosophy
- Implement concepts from scratch when possible
- Focus on intuition and assumptions
- Every notebook is interview-ready

## 📚 Learning Sources
Concepts synthesized from multiple courses and reimplemented independently.
